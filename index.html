            <p align="justify">My name is Camille Modeste. I am a student from CentraleSup√©lec school of engineering. I made this website to tell you more about me, and to carry out a few personal projects.</p>
            <p align="justify">This is the first website I have ever made. I often wondered if I could create a website of my own, but I never really had a reason for doing one. I guess I found one. Let's get started.</p>            
            <p align="justify">The tab "experience" features my professional experience, as well as my education, and miscellaneous projects I took part in.</p>            
            <p align="justify">The following tab introduces an image recognition test that I named "The Game". It is still in construction. It will consist in a page in which the users will be shown an icon, and have to try to draw a copy of it. Then, they will draw a picture of their own, and I will try and guess what they have drawn. You can read more details about the project by clicking on its tab. </p>
            <!-- [MAYBE THIS SENTENCE SHOULD BE DIRECTLY ON THE GAME PAGE : , using Google Cloud Platform as a data platform; I will eventually use a Google algorithm or ML API to recognize the drawing, but I want to train it with my own data. I don't want to just use a pre-trained drawing recognition model, or make an API call to Google's quickdraw.] -->
            <p align="justify">The final tab, named "Data Biz Viz", is going to be a business case study I imagined. My idea is to build a city-attractivity KPI based on the price and number of travel published/seats booked every Friday on Blablacar. Why this study ? I have travelled a lot with Blablacar, and I think it gives a fair and accurate representation of French travellers today. So I think it could be one of the most effective way of knowing how attractive a city is to travellers, using open-data. Why using the price ? It is a B2C platform, with drivers and passengers agreeing on a price it costs to go from a city to another (agreeing means driver publishing, passenger booking). So this price represents what they both think to be the value of the city. </p> <!--  [MAYBE PUT ALL THIS DIRECTLY ON THE DATA BIZ VIZ PAGE : Of course it is biased (what if some city has a direct train line to another, e.g Rennes-Brest, while another don't e.g Nantes-Brest, of course some trips will be biased. But I am positively sure that building such a KPI is possible. It won't be a KPI one can use to compare two cities, but more like a KPI that a city can watch to know its attractivity level. Like : prices drop, but the gas prices didn't go down. What is the problem ? Too many cars but not enough passengers : why ? Or more simply : oh passengers dropped 15% this week compared to 2 months ago. This loss was linear though time. No event can explain this drop (like some discount on trains, or people raising their fees), what is happening ? There is a chance this KPI is not relevant, but I cannot tell until I try).] -->
            <p align="justify">Now that you know almost everything about this website, let me introduce myself. As it is not a personal diary or a biography, I will just go to the essential: I am curious and I am always craving for new experiences. Therefore, I guess I am not quite the same person everyday. I love running, soccer, and acting, but as I have been between places the past few years, I haven't been able to settle in a team lately. I started bouldering with my sister last summer, and I must say I quite enjoy the experience, because that is an activity that seems easy and can be practiced solo, but it isn't. First, you have to analyze, plan your route just like you would do in a mind game. Second, you have to practice, develop your technical moves and identify your common failures. This becomes much more easy and efficient to achieve when someone is watching you from the ground to first give you tips while you are climbing, and then to give you advice after you climbed, in order to help you improve. In addition to that, you also become better at cbouldering by watching others climbing. </p>
            <p align="justify">Why am I looking for a job in data? In the year 2018, everybody was talking about data. It was said to provide great insights on someone's business, able to predict people's actions. I wanted to know what was so magical about data. So I took a few classes in Big Data. It wasn't magical, but our datasets were not "big", and our means really limited. So I applied for internships in data teams, to see how different it could be in the business world. Still no magic, but a whole world of jobs I didn't know : data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, are just the tip of the iceberg. I am still curious ahout data, and I feel that there are still a lot of things that I don't know about it. And I am eager to learn. </p>
            <p align="justify">I assisted to a conference in 2018, from a man who worked for the GIGN, Bernard Thellier. At the end of his speech, he said : "One day, I woke up to go to work, and I told myself "Why ?". That's how I knew I should stop my career in the GIGN : I cannot be the best at my job if I'm asking myself this kind of question.". This is how I know I like my job. I have never asked myself "Why ?", and I know that the day I do, I will start looking for new challenges.</p>
