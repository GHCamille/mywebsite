            <p align="justify">My name is Camille Modeste. I'm a student from CentraleSup√©lec school of engineering. And I am currently looking for a job.</p>
            <p align="justify">I love travelling, I've travelled throught Europe and Asia during my gap year. I also enjoy sports such as running, rugby and soccer, but I haven't played in a long time, as I would need to settle somewhere to join a team.</p>       
            <p align="justify">I have a thing for data ever since my first internship. I chose data in the first place because at that time people were talking about data as if it was magic. I wanted to know what it really was. So I applid as a data analyst in several companies, to have the most "end-of-the-pipe" view possible. That is how I became a business analyst for Everoad. It turns out that I learned a lot about business during this internship, which I don't regret, because I had nothing but class knowledge with pricing before. I also happened to work a lot with a data engineer colleague. Working with him was a really interesting and motivating experience. I therefore planned to have my second gap-year internship as a data engineer. But I came across Novade offer, which was not data engineering. It was data science engineering. It was more like a general technical role. I had responsibility for data analysis, data engineering and data science, all in python, for one category of data in the company (for the "Quality data"). </p>
            <p align="justify">The after two interships in startups, I wanted to have an experience in a large company. That's how I came to work for Accenture. I really enjoy working here, my colleagues are really interesting, and I learn new things everyday. We often work in teams of 4-5 people. That was not the case in my previous internships, in which someone often had to deal with a subject on their own. I feel that I learn more when I work with other people.</p>
