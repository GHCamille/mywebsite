            <p align="justify">My name is Camille Modeste. I'm a student from CentraleSup√©lec school of engineering. I made this website to tell you more about me, and to test a few things.</p>
            <p align="justify">This is the first website I've ever made. Why make one ? Well, as I've just told you, I feel like it's agood way to tell you more about me, and it's also because, as everybody, I go a lot on the internet, wondered a few times if I could make a website of my own, but then I never really had a reason for it. I guess I found one, so let's get started.</p>       
            <p align="justify">What can you see on this website ? There is a sort of resume I made in the tad "experience", with links on the several experiences, projects, trainings that I took. Then, there are some tests, like "The Game". It is still in progress, but it will basically consist in a page in which you will be able to draw some pictures, then draw a picture of your own, and I will try and guess what you are drawing, using Google Cloud Platform as a data platform. I won't be using pre-trained ML API's, so it's going to take some time for me to build my database. But then I will use a Google algorithm to recognize your drawing though.</p>
            <p align="justify">Then, as you can see, there is a "DataVizBiz" tab. So this is going to be a business case study I imagined. I guess it would be possible to build a city-attractivity KPI based on the price and number of seats booked/travel published every Friday on Blablacar. Why this study ? I've met a lot of people thanks to Blablacar. And had conversations with people I would normally never had spoken to. I think that this is the most open-data effective way of knowing how attractive a city is. Of course it is biased (what if some city has a direct train line to another, e.g Rennes-Brest, while another don't e.g Nantes-Brest, of course some trips will be biased. But I'm sure once I have enough data, I must be able to get rid of the biased. Plus, not trying is failing). </p>
            <p align="justify">Enough about this website, who am I ? Tough question, I guess I could say I'm curious. I'm craving for new experiences. Therefore I guess I'm not quite the same person everyday. I love running, soccer, rugby, acting. Although I've been between place the past few years, and therefore I haven't been able to settle in a team recently. I've been practicing into wall climbing with my sister these past weeks.</p>
            <p align="justify">Ok but all this doesn't tell you the reason why I'm looking for a job in data. True. In the year 2018, everybody was talking about data as if it was magical. I wanted to know what was so magical about it. So I took a few classes in Big Data. It wasn't magical, but our dataset were not "big", and our means really limited. So I applied for interships in data teams. Maybe there is enough data in businesses to make it magical. Still, no magic. But a whole world of possibilities : data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, are just the tip of the iceberg. I'm still curious ahout data, and I feel that there are still a lot of things that I don't know about it. And I'm eager to learn. I assisted to a conference in 2018, from a man who worked for the GIGN, Bernard Thellier. And he said "One day, I woke up to go to work, and I told myself "Why ?". That's how I knew I should stop my careeer in the GIGN, and start looking for a new challenge.". I'm sure it will happen some day for me, surely I will be tired of data at some point. But I feel I have enough challenges to tackle to leave me a few good years before this happens.</p>
