                <li> Google Cloud Platform for the architecture.</li>
                <li> Collect data through Blablacar API every week (CRON).</li>
                <li> Python in Google Cloud Functions.</li>

            <p>My idea is to build a city-attractiveness KPI based on the price and number of travel published/seats booked every Friday on Blablacar. Why this study ? I have travelled a lot with Blablacar, and I think it gives a fair and accurate representation of French travellers today. So I think it could be one of the most effective way of knowing how attractive a city is to travellers, using open-data. Why using the price ? It is a B2C platform, with drivers and passengers agreeing on a price it costs to go from a city to another (agreeing means driver publishing, passenger booking). So this price represents what they both think the city is worth. </p> 
            <p> Of course it is biased (what if some city has a direct train line to another, e.g Rennes-Brest, while another don't e.g Nantes-Brest, of course some trips will be biased. But I am positively sure that building such a KPI is possible. It won't be a KPI one can use to compare two cities, but more like a KPI that a city can watch to know its attractiveness level. Like : prices drop, but the gas prices didn't go down. What is the problem ? Too many cars but not enough passengers : why ? Or more simply : oh passengers dropped 15% this week compared to 2 months ago. This loss was linear though time. No event can explain this drop (like some discount on trains, or people raising their fees), what is happening ? There is a chance this KPI is not relevant, but we cannot tell unless we try).</p>
            <p> For now all we are doing is some data collection every Friday, and explore to try and find some relevant insights (‚ö†Ô∏è the data you can see here is fake data to test graphs layouts.): </p>
